# Installs ghul-cli, compiled with Native AOT, together with the compiler it
# ships beside it.
#
# Needs a POSIX shell, tar, and curl or wget. It needs nothing else: no .NET
# SDK, no .NET runtime, and no build tooling. What it installs is the same
# two things whether or not this machine ever had .NET on it.
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghul-lang/ghul-cli/main/install.sh | sh
#
# Or, to see what it would do first:
#
#   sh install.sh --dry-run
#
# A machine that does have the SDK may prefer `dotnet tool install -g ghul.cli`,
# which is what gives the REPL and the Jupyter kernel - both of which host a
# session in this process and so need a .NET runtime. The REPL does not work
# in the AOT build, which is why this script installs the tool rather than the
# whole SDK.

  --help            this text

Installing puts a directory on PATH if it is not already on it; the script
says which, and prints the line to add if you would rather do it yourself.

The tool goes to ~/.local/opt/ghul and the compiler it ships goes into the
ghul-cli cache (~/.cache/ghul-cli, or XDG_CACHE_HOME where that is set),
since that is where ghul-cli looks for it and where 'ghul cache clear'
clears it.
